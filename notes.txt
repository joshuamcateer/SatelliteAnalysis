	- Preprocessing
        Colour mode changes
        pan sharpening
	- Detection of buildings, cars, planes,
		Use a different yolo model for cars planes and buildings
	- Precise building footprints
		○ Yolov8 segments buildings well, although there is some error
	- Generate GeoJson file of building footprints (no idea)
		○ Geojson package takes in polygons which can come from yolov8
	- Superimpose building footprints on images
        yolo segmentation handles this
	- Tag buildings with damage
        The damage mapping handles this, although not specifically tagged
	- Classify buildings as damaged or undamaged]
	- Assess degree of damage, none, low, medium, high, full. (5 levels)
		○ I couldn't find any specific data for this, however this would be easy to do using a simlar classifer to the one I impliement. I would just need more classes.
